## Step 1: Environment Setup

**Pedagogical Focus:** Removing technical barriers to emphasize conceptual learning.

### Setting Up Google Colab
1. Navigate to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Create a new notebook: **File â†’ New notebook**
3. Familiarize yourself with the interface

### Why Colab for Humanities Programming?
- No software installation required
- Consistent environment across different computers
- Built-in access to data science libraries
- Easy sharing and collaboration features

**Teaching Observation:** Notice how cloud-based tools eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem that often frustrates humanities students learning programming.

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "What are the advantages and disadvantages of cloud-based programming environments for student learning?"
- "How do I structure a first programming lesson to minimize technical anxiety?"

---

## Step 2: Library Installation and Introduction

**Pedagogical Focus:** Demonstrating the building-block nature of programming.

### Installing Required Libraries
```python
!pip install atproto pandas matplotlib seaborn requests python-dotenv
```

### Understanding the Toolkit
Each library serves a specific purpose in digital humanities work:

- **atproto:** Connects to Bluesky's decentralized protocol
- **pandas:** Manipulates and analyzes structured data
- **matplotlib/seaborn:** Creates visualizations
- **requests:** Handles web-based data retrieval

**Teaching Moment:** Programming resembles traditional scholarship - we build on existing tools and methods rather than creating everything from scratch.

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "Explain why programming uses libraries instead of writing everything from scratch"
- "How do I help students understand when to use different data analysis tools?"
- "What's an effective analogy for explaining programming libraries to humanities students?"

---

## Step 3: Data Collection - Understanding Digital Texts

**Pedagogical Focus:** Treating social media posts as cultural texts requiring interpretive frameworks.

### Authentication Setup
```python
from atproto import Client
from google.colab import userdata

# Using Colab's secure credential storage
username = userdata.get('BLUESKY_USERNAME')
app_password = userdata.get('BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD')

client = Client()
client.login(username, app_password)
```

### Cultural and Ethical Considerations
Before collecting data, we must consider:
- **Consent and Privacy:** Public posts vs. intended audience
- **Representation:** Whose voices are included or excluded?
- **Context:** How platform design shapes expression
- **Purpose:** Academic research vs. commercial exploitation

**Teaching Observation:** Notice how technical instruction includes ethical reflection from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "What ethical frameworks should guide digital humanities data collection?"
- "How do I teach students to recognize bias in digital datasets?"
- "What's the difference between studying public discourse and surveillance?"

---

## Step 4: Humanities Research Applications

**Pedagogical Focus:** Connecting computational methods to disciplinary research questions.

### Historical Studies Applications

**Research Questions:**
- How do contemporary discussions of historical events reveal shifting collective memory?
- What patterns in anniversary commemorations show evolving historical consciousness?
- How do digital communities construct and contest historical narratives?

```python
def analyze_historical_discourse(posts_df):
    """Examine how historical events are discussed and remembered"""
    
    # Identify temporal references
    historical_periods = ['civil war', 'world war', 'great depression', 'cold war']
    temporal_patterns = posts_df[posts_df['text'].str.contains('|'.join(historical_periods), case=False)]
    
    # Analyze commemorative language
    commemorative_words = ['remember', 'honor', 'anniversary', 'legacy']
    
    return temporal_patterns
```

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How can computational methods complement traditional historical research?"
- "What digital sources might historians overlook and why?"
- "How do we teach students to contextualize digital discourse within broader historical patterns?"

### Literary and Cultural Studies Applications

**Research Questions:**
- How do narrative conventions from traditional literature appear in social media storytelling?
- What forms of community-building emerge around shared literary texts?
- How do digital platforms influence genre development and evolution?

```python
def analyze_narrative_structures(posts_df):
    """Identify storytelling patterns in social media posts"""
    
    # Look for narrative markers
    story_beginnings = ['once', 'yesterday', 'story time', 'thread']
    narrative_devices = ['meanwhile', 'suddenly', 'then', 'finally']
    
    # Identify serialized content
    thread_markers = posts_df['text'].str.contains('1/', case=False)
    
    return narrative_analysis
```

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How do we apply close reading techniques to computational analysis results?"
- "What's lost and gained when we scale literary analysis computationally?"
- "How can students maintain critical perspective when using algorithmic tools?"

### Philosophy and Cultural Theory Applications

**Research Questions:**
- How do philosophical concepts circulate and transform in popular digital discourse?
- What ethical frameworks emerge in online community governance?
- How do digital technologies reshape fundamental concepts of identity and authority?

```python
def analyze_concept_circulation(posts_df):
    """Track how philosophical ideas spread and evolve"""
    
    # Identify philosophical terminology
    philosophical_terms = ['justice', 'freedom', 'truth', 'identity', 'community']
    
    # Analyze conceptual networks
    concept_patterns = posts_df[posts_df['text'].str.contains('|'.join(philosophical_terms), case=False)]
    
    return concept_analysis
```

### Religious Studies Applications

**Research Questions:**
- How do religious communities adapt traditional practices to digital environments?

- "How can computational methods reveal patterns while preserving spiritual meaning?"

---

## Step 5: Data Processing - From Raw to Interpretable

**Pedagogical Focus:** Understanding data as constructed, not naturally occurring.

### Processing Pipeline
```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

def process_cultural_data(raw_posts):
    """Transform API data into analyzable cultural dataset"""
    
    processed_data = []
    for post in raw_posts.feed:
        # Extract cultural and temporal features
        post_data = {
            'created_at': post.post.record.created_at,
            'text': post.post.record.text,
            'engagement_total': post.post.reply_count + post.post.repost_count + post.post.like_count,
            'has_media': bool(post.post.embed),
            'character_count': len(post.post.record.text),
            'reply_context': post.reply is not None,
            'language_markers': extract_language_features(post.post.record.text)
        }
        processed_data.append(post_data)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(processed_data)
```

### Critical Questions for Students
- What assumptions about "meaningful" data underlie our processing choices?
- How does platform design influence what we can measure?
- What cultural nuances might computational processing obscure?

**Teaching Observation:** Notice how technical instruction includes interpretive questions that prepare students for humanistic analysis.

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How do I help students understand that data processing involves interpretive choices?"
- "What questions should humanities students ask about any dataset?"
- "How can we make the constructed nature of data visible to students?"

---

## Step 6: Temporal Analysis - Understanding Cultural Time

**Pedagogical Focus:** Connecting computational patterns to cultural and historical rhythms.

### Analyzing Posting Patterns
```python
# Daily activity patterns
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).dt.date
daily_activity = df.groupby('date').size()

# Hourly patterns revealing cultural rhythms
df['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).dt.hour
df['weekday'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).dt.day_name()

# Weekend vs weekday cultural differences
weekend_patterns = df[df['weekday'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])]
weekday_patterns = df[~df['weekday'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])]
```

### Interpretive Framework
Computational time patterns require cultural interpretation:
- **Liturgical time:** How do religious observances appear in posting patterns?
- **Academic time:** How do semester cycles influence scholarly discourse?
- **Historical time:** How do anniversaries and commemorations shape temporal activity?
- **Personal time:** How do life rhythms vary across communities?

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How do we distinguish between technical artifacts and culturally meaningful patterns?"
- "What temporal frameworks from my discipline could inform computational time analysis?"
- "How can students learn to contextualize digital time within broader cultural patterns?"

---

## Step 7: Visualization as Argument

**Pedagogical Focus:** Understanding visualizations as rhetorical constructions, not neutral representations.

### Creating Interpretive Visualizations
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set style appropriate for academic presentation
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
sns.set_palette("husl")

# Cultural activity heatmap
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
activity_pivot = df.pivot_table(
    values='text', 
    index='hour', 
    columns='weekday', 
    aggfunc='count',
    fill_value=0
)

sns.heatmap(activity_pivot, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='YlOrRd', ax=ax)
ax.set_title('Community Activity Patterns: Cultural Rhythms in Digital Time')
ax.set_xlabel('Day of Week')
ax.set_ylabel('Hour of Day')
```

### Visual Rhetoric Considerations
Every visualization makes arguments:
- **Color choices:** What emotions or associations do colors evoke?
- **Scale decisions:** What patterns become visible or invisible?
- **Framing:** How do titles and labels shape interpretation?
- **Omissions:** What data remains outside the visualization frame?

**Teaching Observation:** Notice how visualization instruction includes critical media literacy alongside technical skills.

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How can students learn to read visualizations critically while creating them?"
- "What are common ways visualizations can mislead viewers about cultural patterns?"
- "How do we teach the relationship between aesthetic choices and argumentative force?"

## Step 8: Interpretation and Scholarly Context

**Pedagogical Focus:** Connecting computational results to disciplinary knowledge and theoretical frameworks.

### Contextualizing Computational Findings

#### Historical Contextualization
```python
def contextualize_temporal_patterns(activity_data, historical_events):
    """Connect computational patterns to historical context"""
    
    # Identify anomalous activity periods
    activity_threshold = activity_data.mean() + (2 * activity_data.std())
    high_activity_periods = activity_data[activity_data > activity_threshold]
    
    # Cross-reference with historical events
    contextual_analysis = []
    for date, activity_level in high_activity_periods.items():
        potential_contexts = check_historical_events(date, historical_events)
        contextual_analysis.append({
            'date': date,
            'activity_level': activity_level,
            'potential_contexts': potential_contexts
        })
    
    return contextual_analysis
```

#### Literary and Cultural Analysis
- **Genre theory:** How do social media posts negotiate between personal narrative and public discourse?
- **Community formation:** What linguistic markers indicate belonging or exclusion?
- **Cultural transmission:** How do ideas, values, and practices spread through digital networks?

### Scholarly Integration Strategies
- **Primary/Secondary Source Framework:** Treating social media as primary cultural documents requiring scholarly interpretation
- **Theoretical Application:** Applying disciplinary theories (postcolonial, feminist, historical) to computational findings
- **Methodological Triangulation:** Combining computational analysis with traditional humanities methods

**AI Practice Prompts:**
- "How can computational findings inform traditional humanities arguments?"
- "What disciplinary theories could help interpret these digital cultural patterns?"
- "How do we teach students to maintain scholarly rigor when working with large-scale data?"
