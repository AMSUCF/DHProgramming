## Three-Tier AI Pedagogical Framework

### **Level 1: Code Comprehension & Debugging**
*For students building foundational understanding*

**Prompt Examples:**
- "Explain this error message and how to fix it"
- "Walk me through what this code block accomplishes step by step"
- "I used str.split() before. How is str.split().str.len() different?"

**Teaching Goal:** Build confidence through understanding existing code

### **Level 2: Conceptual Application & Adaptation**
*For students connecting programming to disciplinary knowledge*

**Prompt Examples:**
- "How would I modify this approach for historical data?"
- "In my text project, I used find/replace. How could I use similar pattern matching here?"
- "What's the computational thinking behind this solution?"

**Teaching Goal:** Connect technical skills to research questions

### **Level 3: Critical Evaluation & Extension**
*For students ready to evaluate computational approaches*

**Prompt Examples:**
- "What are the limitations of this algorithmic approach?"
- "Compare the ethical considerations between generating creative text and analyzing real social media posts"
- "How does this method compare to traditional research practices?"

**Teaching Goal:** Develop critical digital literacy

## Session 1: Building on Text Processing Experience

### From Creative Text â†’ Analytical Text
Your previous skills extend naturally:
- Text cleaning â†’ Data preprocessing
- Pattern replacement â†’ Pattern recognition  
- Creative constraints â†’ Analytical filters
- Output verification â†’ Result interpretation

### Sample Code - Basic Data Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime
import re
from collections import Counter

# Sample dataset
sample_posts = [
    {"text": "Excited about the new digital humanities semester!", "timestamp": "2025-01-15", "engagement": 12, "type": "academic"},
    {"text": "Reading Toni Morrison again - her work never gets old #literature", "timestamp": "2025-01-16", "engagement": 18, "type": "literary"},
    {"text": "Conference presentations due next week ðŸ˜… #phdlife", "timestamp": "2025-01-17", "engagement": 15, "type": "academic"}
]

df = pd.DataFrame(sample_posts)
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df['word_count'] = df['text'].str.split().str.len()
```

**AI Practice:** Try prompts from each level with this code

## Session 2: Pattern Recognition and Analysis

### Text Categorization (Building on Find/Replace Experience)
```python
def categorize_posts(text_series):
    """Categorize posts by content - similar to your text constraints"""
    categories = []
    for text in text_series:
        text_lower = text.lower()
        if any(word in text_lower for word in ['reading', 'book', 'author', 'literature']):
            categories.append('literary')
        elif any(word in text_lower for word in ['research', 'conference', 'semester', 'phd']):
            categories.append('academic')
        else:
            categories.append('general')
    return categories

df['auto_category'] = categorize_posts(df['text'])
```

### Text Analysis (Extending Your Text Manipulation)
```python
def analyze_text_features(df):
    """Extract features like you did with text elements"""
    all_text = ' '.join(df['text'].str.lower())
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', all_text)
    word_freq = Counter(words)
    
    academic_terms = ['research', 'analysis', 'conference', 'digital', 'reading']
    academic_word_freq = {word: count for word, count in word_freq.items() if word in academic_terms}
    
    return academic_word_freq

academic_words = analyze_text_features(df)
```

**Key Teaching Moment:** Students connect familiar text processing to analytical thinking

## Session 3: AI-Assisted Visualization

### From Text Outputs â†’ Visual Analysis
```python
# Create comprehensive visualization
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 12))

# 1. Engagement by category
category_engagement = df.groupby('auto_category')['engagement'].mean()
category_engagement.plot(kind='barh', ax=axes[0,0])

# 2. Word count vs engagement  
axes[0,1].scatter(df['word_count'], df['engagement'])

# 3. Timeline
daily_engagement = df.groupby(df['timestamp'].dt.date)['engagement'].sum()
axes[1,0].plot(daily_engagement.index, daily_engagement.values, marker='o')

# 4. Category distribution
df['auto_category'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie', ax=axes[1,1])

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### AI Interpretation Prompts by Level

**Beginner:**
- "What story does this engagement chart tell about academic vs literary posts?"

**Intermediate:**  
- "What cultural factors might explain this engagement pattern?"

**Advanced:**
- "What assumptions about social media behavior are embedded in these visualizations?"
