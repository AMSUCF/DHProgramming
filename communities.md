## Communities to Approach Cautiously

**r/ChatGPT** - While large (9M+ members), the casual and entertainment-focused nature may not align with serious educational goals. The high noise-to-signal ratio could overwhelm pedagogical discussions.

**Midjourney Communities** - Primarily focused on image generation rather than programming applications. Limited relevance for coding education unless specifically teaching AI art integration.

## Recommended Approach

Start with **r/MachineLearning**, **OpenAI Community Forum**, and **Stack Overflow** for foundational technical knowledge. Add **Hugging Face Communities** for open-source focus and **r/ChatGPTCoding** for practical application. Use **Import AI** newsletter for staying current with research implications.

Focus on communities that emphasize technical depth, educational applications, and practical implementation over entertainment or casual use.
