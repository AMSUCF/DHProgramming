## Session 1: Building Real Corpus with Bluesky API

### Jupyter Notebook Workflow Management
**Cell Organization Strategy:**
1. **Setup Cell:** Libraries and authentication (run once)
2. **Data Collection Cell:** API calls (modify and re-run)
3. **Processing Cell:** Clean and structure data
4. **Analysis Cells:** Individual analyses (iterate with AI)
5. **Visualization Cell:** Final outputs

**AI-Assisted Iteration Pattern:**
- Keep working code in separate cells
- Use AI to modify copies before replacing originals
- Save successful versions before experimenting

### Getting Started with Real Data Collection

**AI Prompts for Setup:**
- "Help me install the required libraries for Bluesky API analysis: atproto, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn"
- "Show me how to securely authenticate with the Bluesky API using Google Colab secrets"
- "I'm getting an authentication error with the AT Protocol. What might be wrong?"

**AI Prompts for Data Collection:**
- "Write a function to collect posts from a specific Bluesky user handle"
- "How do I search for posts containing specific hashtags on Bluesky?"
- "Create a function that collects posts from multiple users and combines them into one dataset"
- "My data collection is only getting 10 posts per user. How can I get more historical data?"

**AI Prompts for Data Processing:**
- "Convert this Bluesky API response into a pandas DataFrame with relevant features"
- "Help me extract engagement metrics, timestamps, and text features from Bluesky posts"
- "I have inconsistent API response structures. How do I handle missing fields robustly?"

**AI Iteration Strategy:** Use prompts like:
- "This code works but is slow. How can I optimize the data collection?"
- "I'm getting rate limited by the API. What's the best way to handle this?"
- "How do I save my collected data as a CSV file for backup?"
