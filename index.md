## Workshop Overview

In this team-taught workshop, we invite scholars to join us in exploring the relationship between generative AI and the future of programming pedagogy in the digital humanities and a frontline of what the MLA-CCCC Joint Task Force on Writing and AI called "critical AI literacy." Generative AI offers opportunities to make programming more accessible to diverse learners, and we explore how to use these emerging technologies to build inclusive pathways into programming through natural language interfaces and "literate programming." 

This course will emphasize two critical programming languages, JavaScript and Python, that are commonly taught in humanities courses due to their applicability for interactive experiences, public humanities, and textual analysis. This workshop will build participants' comfort with both generating and debugging code with AI tools, as well as deploying generative AI outside of mainstream commercial projects. Participants will be invited to approach GitHub, Copilot, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, and Jupyter Notebooks through a beginner's mind, working through, critiquing, and developing assignments and pedagogical applications or their own classrooms. Participants with and without programming experience are welcome.

## Prior to the Workshop

Please complete the suggested pre-readings prior to the workshop: note that some of the readings included are for reference, as indicated.

Please install the following software prior to the workshop:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Create an account (ideally using a .edu email for access to all features) and install the desktop software for your operating system.
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) - If possible, apply for additional access for advanced models and usage limits. We recommend doing this before traveling to DHSI, as it uses location as part of the application.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Select "Download" for your operating system

We will walk through the installation process of more complicated tools during the workshop, so please make sure you have administrative access to the laptop you bring for completing exercises throughout.
